</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Allright, let's start implementing a blog.</p>
<p>First off, let's get the Github Pages up first.</p>
<p>Going to <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a> gives the instructions.</p>
<p>I need to create a repository named after my username and push the repo. Easy enough. Next I need to create an index.html file. Github recommends &quot;hello world&quot;. Sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Using git to add and push my local repo up to the newly created repository. Visiting benhoff.github.io now shows our the new web page, hello world! Neat!</p>
<p>Cool, now that I've got my page up, on to the static website generation. I'll start by installing pelican in a virtual environment.</p>
<p><cite>mkdir swdev/blog</cite>
<cite>cd swdev/blog</cite>
<cite>python -m venv venv</cite>
<cite>source  venv bin activate</cite>
<cite>pip install pelican</cite></p>
<p>Pelican has a quick start. Hold my breath here ;)</p>
<p><cite>pelican-quickstart</cite></p>
<p>Oh man, I need a blog title? Hoff's heroes? Let's just stick with Ben's Blog for now. The only other question I'm stumped on is the generation of a Fabfile/Makefile. Let's say yes for now, and we can always delete it later.</p>
<p>Looks like pelican is familiar with using Github pages. Nice.</p>
<p>Awesome, the quickstart dumped a bunch of new files and folders into the directory. I've already written an initial thoughts post about this blog. Let's dump that in the content directory.</p>
<p><cite>mv initial_blog_thoughts.txt content/initial_blog_thoughts.rst</cite></p>
<p>I'm following along here (TODO: get permenant link)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html">http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/content.html</a></p>
<p>There's a bunch of metadata that pelcian says I'm missing, including the date, tags, category, slug, authors, and summary. Let's go ahead and add all of those.</p>
<p>I'll need to go through and add in some of the resturctured text for the post, but I'll do it later.</p>
<p>Right now, I want to add in some <cite>pages</cite>. According to Pelican, Pages are for _About_ and _Contact_ pages. That sounds good.</p>
<p><cite>mkdir pages</cite></p>
<p>Uh, I thought I could create an <cite>index.html</cite>? Doesn't look like I can, I'll just follow the next step in the tutorial and see where I end up.</p>
<p><cite>pelican /path/to/my/content</cite></p>
<p>Looks like the content needs to be the file directory and not the acutal content.</p>
<p>Nice, the output directory has an index file in it already. Let's check it out using my browser.</p>
<p>Ok, I'm not in love with the theme, but I can work with everything else.</p>
<p>Let's push this up and do it live.</p>
<p>(Get permenant link)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/tips.html">http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/tips.html</a></p>
<p>Ok, not as easy as I would like. We're adventuring now. Pelican recommends the use of <cite>ghp-import</cite>. I hate this kind of adventuring, since I'm pretty sure it's not going to work. Sigh. Here we go.</p>
<p><cite>pip install ghp-import</cite>
<cite>ghp-import output</cite> # &lt;- this is enough to drive a man crazy
<cite>git push git&#64;github.com:benhoff/benhoff.github.io.git gh-pages:master</cite></p>
<p>Yea, that didn't work. Looks like since I've already pushed I'm going to have issues. Color me surprised. I swear, this is my surprised face.</p>
<p>I've now got a <cite>gh-pages</cite> branch. That might be worth looking into. After some digging looks like I need to push the gh-pages branch.</p>
<p><cite>git push origin gh-pages</cite></p>
<p>That didn't appear to work. Maybe deleting my old &quot;hello world&quot; index file will help.</p>
<p>Nope. Now we're just 404ing. Looks like for a user page, content must be in the master. Well screw that. Let's create a new repo for the blog code and then I'll just push the github.io pages separate.</p>
<p><em>New repo named `blog`</em>
<cite>git remote set-url git&#64;github.com:benhoff/blog.git</cite>
<cite>git remote add publish git&#64;github.com:benhoff/benhoff.github.io</cite>
<cite>git push -f publish gh-pages:master</cite></p>
<p>I'll still have to manually push the gh-pages branch, but this is good enough for now.</p>
